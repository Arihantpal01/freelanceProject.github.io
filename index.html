            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- PARAGRAPH START -->
            <p class="parag">Technology comes from the Greek words techne, which means "art, skill, cunning of hand,"
                and -o, which means "science of craft." Over the last 200 years, the definition of "technology" has
                shifted dramatically. The term was uncommon in English before the twentieth century, and it was used to
                describe or study the useful arts or to imply to technical education, as in the Massachusetts
                Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).

                The term "technology" became popular in the twentieth century as a result of the Second Industrial
                Revolution. When American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the
                German concept of Technik into "technology," the term's meanings shifted. There is a distinction between
                technik and technologie in German and other European languages that is lacking in English, which
                commonly translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" had come to mean both the
                study of and the practise of the industrial arts.

                "All tools, machinery, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothes, communicating and
                transportation devices, and the abilities through which humans manufacture and utilise them," declared
                American sociologist Read Bain in 1937.

                Bain's term is still widely used today by academics, particularly social scientists. Applied
                science, rather than the objects that people manufacture and use, is how scientists and engineers
                commonly define technology. Scholars have recently borrowed from European "technique" philosophers
                to broaden the definition of technology to include diverse forms of instrumental reason, such as
                Foucault's work on technologies</p>

            <p class="parag">technik and technologie are two nouns that are not commonly translated as "technology" in
                English. By the 1930s, "technology" had come to mean both the study of and the practise of the

                philosophers to broaden the definition of technology to include diverse forms of instrumental reason, as

            <p class="parag">
                A number of definitions have been proposed by dictionaries and academics. "The use of science in
                industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful products or solve difficulties," according to the
                Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary, and "a machine, piece of equipment, procedure, etc., made by
                technology," according to the Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary. Another definition given by
                Ursula Franklin in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" speech is "practise, the way we do things around
                here." Rather than implying a specific sector of technology, the term is frequently used to refer to
                high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology in general.In his book
                Technics and Time, Bernard Stiegler describes technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means
                other than life," and as "the pursuit of life by means other than life."

            <h2>Why These Technologies?</h2>
            <p class="parag">Technology is the outcome of accumulated knowledge and application in all techniques,
                skills,
                methods, and procedures utilised in industrial production and scientific study that is
                always evolving. For the intended aim of an organisation, technology is incorporated in the
                operation of all machines, with or without thorough understanding of their function. Systems
                are the building blocks of society's technologies. By collecting an input, adjusting this
                input for the system's intended purpose through a process, and then creating an outcome that
                changes the system's final intended purpose, systems apply the intended application of a
                technology's acquired knowledge. A technology system, or technical system, is another name
                for this.</p>

            <p class="parag">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for texts that are
                intended to be viewed on a web browser. Technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
                programming languages like JavaScript can help.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or locally stored files and convert them to
                multimedia web pages. HTML originally featured cues for the document's look and described the structure
                of a web page logically.</p>

            <p class="parag">
                HTML elements are the components that make up HTML pages. Images and other objects, such as interactive
                forms, can be embedded in the produced page using HTML techniques. HTML allows you to create organised
                documents by indicating structural semantics for text elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, links,
                quotations, and other elements. Tags, which are written in angle brackets, separate HTML elements. Tags
                like image /> and input /> insert content into the page immediately. Other tags, such as p>, surround
                and offer information about document text, and may comprise sub-elements such as other tags. The HTML
                tags are not displayed by browsers, but they are used to read the page's content.

                HTML allows scripting languages like JavaScript to insert programmes that influence the behaviour and
                content of online pages. CSS determines the appearance and layout of material. Since 1997, the World
                Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which used to maintain the HTML standards and now maintains the CSS
                standards, has pushed the usage of CSS over explicit presentational HTML. HTML5 is a version of HTML
                that primarily uses the canvas> element in conjunction with javascript to show video and audio.

            <h2>Components in html</h2>
            <p class="parag">
                HTML Components (HTCs) are a legacy technology used in the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser to
                implement script components as Dynamic HTML (DHTML) "behaviors". These files usually have the.htc
                extension and the MIME type "text/x-component."

                HTCs are often defined by an HTML file (with JScript / VBScript) and a set of elements. This aids in the
                organisation of behaviour wrapped in script modules that may be attached to various portions of the DOM
                of a Web page.

                Custom pages enable you to design HTML layouts that may be used offline. Here are a few things to keep

                way.

            <p class="parag" style="font-weight:bold;"> The first step is to improve the content layout.</p>
            <p class="parag">
                When browsing on a mobile phone, the user has a limited amount of screen real estate to deal with.
                The majority of modern phones will automatically zoom out so that the entire website can be seen
                onscreen. This can be beneficial because it offers readers access to the entire site, but it can
                also be annoying when trying to seek content that is only available in a small section of the site.

            <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
            <p class="parag">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language for describing the appearance of a
                document authored in a markup language like HTML.Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a key
                component of the World Wide Web.

                CSS is a style sheet that allows you to separate presentation from content, including layout, colours,
                and fonts.

                This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content, and allow the.css file to be cached to improve page load speed between the pages
                that share the file and its formatting.</p>

                The ability to offer the same markup page in different styles for distinct rendering techniques, such as
                on-screen, in print, by voice (through speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
                tactile devices, is also made possible by the separation of formatting and content. If the information
                is accessible on a mobile device, CSS contains rules for different formatting.

                Cascading gets its name from the priority mechanism used to select which style rule applies when many
                rules match the same element. This priority-cascading strategy is predictable.

                CSS validation service.

            <p class="parag">JavaScript sometimes known as JS, is a computer language that, together with HTML and CSS,
                is one of the basic technologies of the World Wide Web. On the client side, over 97 percent of
                websites employ JavaScript for web page behavior, with third-party libraries frequently
                incorporated.To run the code on users' devices, all major web browsers have a specific JavaScript
                engine.</p>

                JavaScript is an ECMAScript-compliant high-level, frequently just-in-time compiled language.It has
                first-class functions, dynamic typing, and prototype-based object orientation. It's multi-paradigm,
                allowing you to programme in event-driven, functional, or imperative styles. It contains APIs for
                working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model,
                among other things (DOM).

                There are no input/output (I/O) facilities in the ECMAScript standard, such as networking, storage, or
                graphics. In practise, JavaScript APIs for I/O are provided by the web browser or another runtime
                system.

                Originally only used in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now found in a wide range of servers and
                apps. Node.js is the most popular runtime system for this purpose.

                Despite the fact that Java and JavaScript have similar names, syntax, and standard libraries, the two
                languages are very different in design.

            <p class="parag">A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that helps
                developers create web applications such as web services, web resources, and web APIs. Online frameworks
                are a set of guidelines for creating and deploying web applications on the Internet. Web frameworks are
                designed to reduce the overhead associated with standard web development tasks. Many web frameworks, for
                example, provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, as well
                as code reuse. Although they are frequently used to create dynamic websites, they can also be used
                to create static webpages.</p>

                    Angular is an HTML and TypeScript-based platform and framework for creating single-page client
                    applications. TypeScript is used to write Angular. As a set of TypeScript libraries that you load
                    into
                    your apps, it implements core and optional functionality.

                    An Angular application's architecture is based on a few key concepts. The Angular framework's
                    fundamental building pieces are Angular components, which are arranged into NgModules. NgModules are
                    functional groupings of linked code; an Angular application is defined by a set of NgModules. An
                    application must include at least one root module to facilitate bootstrapping, and many more feature
                    modules are common.

                    Components define views, which are collections of screen components that Angular can select and
                    modify
                    based on the logic and data in your programme.

                    Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework
                    that follows the MTV architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation
                    (DSF), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organisation based in the United States.

                    Django's main purpose is to make building complex, database-driven websites easier. The framework
                    prioritises component reusability and "pluggability," as well as less code, low coupling, rapid
                    development, and the "don't repeat yourself" philosophy. Even for settings, files, and data models,
                    Python is used throughout. Django also has an administrative create, read, update, and delete
                    interface
                    that is produced dynamically and customised using admin models.

                    Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, Bitbucket, Nextdoor, and Clubhouse are just a few of the well-known
                    sites

                    Express.js, or simply Express, is a back-end web application framework for Node.js that was
                    distributed
                    under the MIT License as free and open-source software. It is intended for the development of web
                    applications and APIs. It's been dubbed Node.js' de facto standard server framework.

                    TJ Holowaychuk, the original author, defined it as a Sinatra-inspired server,implying that it is
                    simple with numerous functionality available as plugins. Express, together with the MongoDB database
                    software and a JavaScript front-end framework or library, is the back-end component of popular
                    development stacks like MEAN, MERN, or MEVN.
